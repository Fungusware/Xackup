We didnâ€™t want to pay 1000â€™s to backup our XenServer and XCP-ng VMs and now you donâ€™t have to either. You can thank us later ðŸ™‚

Xackup is designed to be an easy to use light weight solution to back-up your XenServer or XCP-ng virtual machines.

Xackup is a commercial product that can be found here : https://www.xenserver-backup.com/ . This repository serves to manage Downloads, Releases and Release Notes
